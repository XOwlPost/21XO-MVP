# 21XO-MVP

## About the Project

21XO-MVP aims to revolutionize the way we interact with NFTs and blockchain technology by integrating cutting-edge cross-chain communication and AI-driven interfaces. Inspired by projects like InterPal and leveraging technologies such as Axelar for seamless cross-chain interoperability, Aragon OSx for decentralized governance, and specialized GPTs for intuitive user interactions, 21XO-MVP stands at the forefront of blockchain innovation.

### Features

- **Cross-Chain NFT Minting:** Utilize Axelar for minting NFTs across different blockchains directly through a chat interface.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Implement Aragon OSx to enable community-driven governance mechanisms.
- **AI-Driven User Experience:** Integrate specialized GPTs to offer a conversational interface for interacting with the blockchain.
