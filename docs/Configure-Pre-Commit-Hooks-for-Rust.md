Incorporating Trunk into your development workflow when contributions to the project involves Rust code. Trunk is a utility tool for Rust projects that simplifies building, bundling, and deploying web applications. If you're referring to using Trunk as a tool for code quality or linting (similar to the usage of "trunk" in some environments for code analysis), it's worth noting that Trunk (in the context of Rust) is primarily a build tool for frontend web applications. However, for Rust code quality and linting, tools like `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` are more directly applicable.

For the sake of clarity and to provide guidance on integrating Rust code quality tools into your workflow, here's an updated section that includes steps for integrating `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt`, along with a hypothetical setup for Trunk if it were to be used for build processes or other custom checks within a pre-commit hook framework.

### Integrating Rust Code Quality Tools

To ensure the Rust code in your project meets high-quality standards, you can integrate `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` into your pre-commit hooks. These tools will check for common mistakes and enforce a consistent code style across your Rust codebase.

#### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install them via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

- Install `pre-commit` as described in the previous sections.

#### Setup Steps

1. **Configure Pre-Commit Hooks for Rust:**
   Add the following entries to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to include Rust's linting and formatting tools:

   ```yaml
   repos:
   - repo: local
     hooks:
     - id: cargo-clippy
       name: Cargo Clippy
       entry: cargo clippy -- -D warnings
       language: system
       types: [rust]
       pass_filenames: false

     - id: cargo-fmt
       name: Cargo fmt
       entry: cargo fmt -- --check
       language: system
       types: [rust]
       pass_filenames: false
   ```

2. **(Optional) Integrate Trunk for Web Application Builds:**
   If your project uses Trunk to build Rust-based web applications, you can add a custom hook to run Trunk commands:

   ```yaml
   - id: trunk-build
     name: Trunk Build
     entry: trunk build --release
     language: system
     types: [html, css, js]
     pass_filenames: false
   ```

3. **Install the Pre-Commit Hooks:**
   With the configuration updated, install the pre-commit hooks as previously described.

4. **Running the Hooks:**
   The pre-commit hooks will automatically run `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt`, and optionally `trunk build` (if configured) on your Rust files whenever you attempt to commit changes.

This setup ensures your Rust code is automatically checked for common issues and formatted according to Rust's style guidelines before each commit. It helps maintain code quality and consistency across your project's Rust codebase.
