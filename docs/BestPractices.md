// Focus on development workflows, coding standards, and Git flow practices. Include sections for each aspect of Git flow, coding standards, and other technical best practices your /team should follow.

### 1. **Feature Branches**

- **Start New Features:** When beginning work on a new feature, create a feature branch off the `develop` (or `preview`, if you've chosen to rename it) branch. Use the convention `feature/your-feature-name`.
- **Finish Features:** Once a feature is completed and tested, merge it back into the `develop` branch. Delete the feature branch if it's no longer needed.

### 2. **Develop and Preview Branch**

- **Continuous Integration:** Regularly push changes from feature branches into this branch to integrate and test new developments. If you're using `preview` as your integration branch, this serves as a live staging area for your team to review.

### 3. **Release Branches**

- **Prepare Releases:** When you're ready to prepare a new release, create a release branch off `develop`. Use the naming convention `release/x.y.z` based on your versioning.
- **Finalize and Merge:** After final testing and adjustments, merge the release branch into `main` (or `master`) and back into `develop` to capture any last-minute changes made during the release process. Tag the merge into `main` with the version number.

### 4. **Hotfix Branches**

- **Urgent Fixes:** For urgent fixes to your production code, create a hotfix branch directly off `main`. Name it using the convention `hotfix/urgent-fix-name`.
- **Merge Back:** Once the fix is complete, merge the hotfix branch into both `main` and `develop` (or `preview`), ensuring that the fix is incorporated into future releases.

### 5. **Main Branch**

- **Production Ready:** The `main` branch represents the production-ready state of your project. Only merge into `main` from release or hotfix branches.

### 6. **Version Tagging**

- **Tag Releases:** When you merge a release into `main`, tag the commit with the version number to mark the release point. If you've set up a `version/` prefix for tags, include it in your tag name.

### Best Practices

- **Regular Pulls:** Regularly pull changes from the remote to keep your local branches up to date and minimize merge conflicts.
- **Branch Cleanup:** Delete branches after merging them to keep your repository clean and manageable.
- **Communication:** Ensure all team members are familiar with the Git flow process and the roles of different branches. Clear communication is key to avoiding confusion.

By adhering to these practices, you can leverage Git flow to streamline your development process, improve collaboration, and manage releases more effectively.
